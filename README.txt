A few things to Keep In Mind:
1. DO NOT introduce unnecessary complexity into the model. Just complete your associated part/task.
2. It is easier to add more, but more difficult to remove or change. Add only what is needed and don't adjust anything else.
3. Prioritize NAMING CONVENTIONS to ensure consistency. If you're using, say, the Naive Bayes Classifier, name the model something like NV_MODEL_1.
4. Your model must follow all preprocessing already done to ensure fairness among all models.
5. DO NOT do unnecessary work; for now, prioritize simplicity. Additional complexity should only be done during model refinement stages. This includes tasks like hyperparameter tuning.
6. Follow the instructions in the IPYNB file. I've made them as simple as possible to guide you.
7. You need not incorporate your own model/work completely into my file yet; you can create a copy of it and highlight where your work is. This will save time when it comes to the integration stage.
8. Use comments if/whenever possible.

Your task:
1. Build a model, in 3 forms: RAW (Unprocessed at all), Slightly processed, and after Data Preprocessing and Engineering. I have already built the Decision Tree, so discuss among one another to choose which model to build upon.
2. Evaluate the performance of all 3 models
3. Build the cross-validation to verify the results obtained.
4. Plot the confusion matrix of errors. (You can ignore the SHAP part.)
5. Use the .csv file. The .xlsx file is there to make it easier to read.
6. Once completed, we will move on to Part B.
